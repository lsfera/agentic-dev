# Publish the prebuilt outer orchestrator image to GHCR

ADR-0014 published the *inner* sandbox images so adopters skip building those.
The *outer* image — the devcontainer the orchestrator itself runs in — was still
built locally on every adopter's machine by `devcontainer up` (base image + the
claude-code / docker-outside-of-docker / node / github-cli features + the
Dockerfile). That is a slow first-run (~2.3 GB, four features) repeated per host.

## Decision

Build the outer image in CI and publish it to GHCR
(`ghcr.io/<owner>/agentic-dev/devcontainer`), multi-arch (`linux/amd64,linux/arm64`).

Because the outer image is a **devcontainer** — its features are applied by the
devcontainer CLI, not by the Dockerfile — a plain `docker build` of
`.devcontainer/Dockerfile` produces a broken image (no node/docker/gh/claude). So
the workflow builds with the **devcontainer CLI** (`devcontainer build --push`),
which resolves the compose config, runs `initializeCommand`, layers the features,
and pushes. Tags mirror the inner-image workflow (semver / branch / sha / `latest`
on the default branch), via `docker/metadata-action`.

This was validated locally: `devcontainer build` on the compose config yields an
image with `node`, `docker`, `gh`, `claude`, and the baked-in `afk`/`hitl`
launchers all present.

## Consequences

- Adopters can consume the prebuilt image instead of building locally — either by
  pointing the compose service at it (`image:`) or adding it as a build
  `cacheFrom` source so `devcontainer up` is a cache hit. The dogfood compose file
  keeps its `build:` block (source of truth); consumption is documented, not
  forced, so local development still builds from the Dockerfile.
- A correctness prerequisite surfaced while validating this: `.devcontainer/`
  uses an allowlist `.dockerignore` (`*` then `!Dockerfile` …), so every file the
  Dockerfile `COPY`s must be allowlisted. The `afk` launcher (ADR — baked-in
  command) was missing its `!afk` entry, which broke the devcontainer build; this
  workflow's validation caught and fixed it.
- The arm64 leg builds under QEMU emulation, so the job is slow (generous
  `timeout-minutes`). If it becomes a bottleneck, switch to native per-arch
  runners (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`) with a manifest-merge step.
- Path-scoped to `.devcontainer/**` on `main`, plus every `v*` tag and manual
  dispatch — kept in a separate workflow from the inner images so a change to one
  image type does not rebuild the other.
